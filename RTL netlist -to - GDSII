RTL Netlist  
  ↓  
  (High-level digital circuit description written in Verilog or VHDL)

Synthesis  
  ↓  
  (Convert RTL to gate-level netlist using logic optimization)

🧮 Key Formula:  
  **Delay (gate) ≈ f(C_load, V_dd, I_drive)**  
  - C_load: Load capacitance  
  - V_dd: Supply voltage  
  - I_drive: Drive current

Floorplanning  
  ↓  
  (Define core area, place I/Os and macros, power grid planning)

📐 Estimation Formula:  
  **Die Area ≈ ∑(Macro Area + Cell Area + Routing Overhead)**

Placement  
  ↓  
  (Place standard cells to optimize timing, congestion, and area)

🧮 Key Concept:  
  **Total Wirelength ≈ ∑ Manhattan Distance between connected cells**

Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)  
  ↓  
  (Build balanced clock network, reduce skew and insertion delay)

🧮 Key Formulas:  
  - **Skew = |Arrival time(farthest FF) - Arrival time(nearest FF)|**  
  - **Insertion Delay = Clock Arrival Time - Clock Source Time**

Routing  
  ↓  
  (Connect all nets using available metal layers while respecting DRC)

🧮 RC Delay Estimation:  
  - **Elmore Delay ≈ R × C_total**  
  - R: Wire resistance, C_total: total capacitance

Post-Route Optimization & ECOs  
  ↓  
  (Fix timing violations, logic changes, incremental placement/routing)

📈 Timing Fix Example:  
  - Add **buffers** to reduce net delay  
  - Gate resizing for improving **setup/hold**

Physical Verification  
  ├─ DRC: (Design Rule Check – ensures layout follows manufacturing rules)  
  ├─ LVS: (Layout vs Schematic – validates layout matches netlist)  
  ├─ ERC: (Electrical Rule Check – checks power/ground connectivity)  
  ├─ Antenna Check: (Prevents charge damage during fabrication)  
  └─ ESD Analysis: (Validates ESD structures for I/O protection)

Power Integrity Analysis  
  ├─ IR Drop  
      - Voltage drop due to resistance in power grid

    🧮 Formula:  
    **V_drop = I × R**  
    - I: Current, R: Resistance of power path

  └─ EM Analysis (Electromigration)  
      - Checks if current density causes metal degradation

    🧮 EM Current Density:  
    **J = I / A**  
    - J: Current Density, A: Cross-sectional area

Timing Signoff (STA)  
  ↓  
  (Static Timing Analysis checks timing across all paths)

🧮 Setup and Hold Slack:  
- **Setup Slack = Data Arrival - Required Time**  
- **Hold Slack = Data Arrival - Earliest Latching Time**

🧮 Worst Negative Slack (WNS) and Total Negative Slack (TNS)

GDSII Generation (Tapeout)  
  ↓  
  (Final layout database sent to foundry for mask generation)
